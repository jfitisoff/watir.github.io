Watir 6.13 is now available on RubyGems. Improved Watir wait syntax, and a few minor fixes.
<!--more-->

***To install:***

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install watir
{% endhighlight %}

***or in your Gemfile:*** 

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "watir", "~> 6.13"
{% endhighlight %}
<p></p>

### Wait for Element Attribute Values

To wait for an attribute value, you used to need to write:

{% highlight ruby %}
element.wait_until { |el| el.text == 'Foo' }
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can do the same thing without a block:

{% highlight ruby %}
element.wait_until(text: 'Foo')
{% endhighlight %}

You can use Regular expressions and/or use more than one attribute value:

{% highlight ruby %}
element.wait_until(text: /Fo/, style: 'block')
{% endhighlight %}


This can still be mixed and matched with timeout and message values:

{% highlight ruby %}
element.wait_until(message: 'Oops', text: 'Foo', timeout: 4)
{% endhighlight %}


### Additional Items

* It used to be that when an element collection was located, the elements would be cached and previously
located elements would be tried before re-locating them. In the process of making collections lazy
loaded, we broke this feature. There should be a minor performance improvement for anyone making extensive
use of collections.

* Watir now supports custom element tag names with Adjacent locators.

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.div(id: "regular_child").parent(tag_name: :grandelement)
{% endhighlight %}

* Watir now supports `#set` and `#clear` on elements with user-editable attribute. This should make 
some WYSIWYG implementations easier to interact with.

* Improved support for [Watigiri](https://github.com/titusfortner/watigiri/)

for the complete history of updates.
