<p>From 2008 through 2013 and then again from 2016 - 2017, Watir had a mostly monthly podcast
interviewing people from the Watir community and discussing things relevant to Test Automation. The podcast
was started and hosted by Zeljko Filipin, with Dave McNulla coming on board to co-host and then take
over the project.</p>
